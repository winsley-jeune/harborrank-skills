description: "Group keywords into page-level clusters by search intent and map each cluster to an existing or new page, flagging cannibalization. Use when the user has a keyword list, saved keywords, or Search Console queries and asks which page should target which keywords, or wants a keyword map, content plan, topic clusters, or to fix pages competing for the same query."

# HarborRank Keyword Clustering

## Goal

Group keywords into page-level clusters and decide which existing or new page should target each cluster. This is a keyword mapping workflow, not just a semantic grouping exercise.

## Step 0: Check connection

Before any other step, confirm the HarborRank MCP tools are loaded. Look for `get_domain_overview` or `list_leads` among your tools, including deferred tools you can load (the name may carry a prefix such as `mcp__harborrank__`). If they are there, call `whoami`: it uses no credits, confirms the user is signed in, and returns `creditsRemaining` for budgeting the run. Do not call a research tool to test the connection.

If neither tool is available, or `whoami` fails because the user is not signed in, tell the user plainly: "HarborRank isn't connected, so I can't pull live HarborRank data yet." Then tell them how to connect it:

- Claude Code with the HarborRank plugin: run `/mcp`, choose `harborrank`, and sign in.
- Claude Code without the plugin: run `claude mcp add --transport http --scope user harborrank https://app.harborrank.com/mcp`, then `/mcp` to sign in.
- Claude on the web, desktop or Cowork: open Customize, then Connectors, search for HarborRank, choose Connect, and sign in. The Free plan needs no card.
- Other clients: add `https://app.harborrank.com/mcp` as a remote MCP server. Setup for each client is at https://harborrank.com/docs/mcp.

Do not stop there. Continue in fallback mode (below). If the user connects HarborRank mid-task, run Step 0 again and switch to the full workflow.

### Plan limits

On hosted HarborRank, research tools spend credits. The Free plan has 1,000 credits a month and one project; paid plans start at $29/month with 15,000 credits. Search Console, saved keywords, rank tracker reads, and site crawls use no credits. A keyword search costs about 50 credits and a domain overview about 80. Full backlinks, lead research (`research_lead`), and Lighthouse checks need a paid plan; on Free, the backlinks tools return a preview (totals and the top 3 referring domains, about 50 credits) with an upgrade link.

- If `creditsRemaining` will not cover the planned calls, give the user the estimate and ask before spending. Use the free tools first.
- If a tool replies that a feature "is included in paid plans", tell the user once which feature needs a paid plan and pass on the upgrade link from the reply, skip that tool for the rest of the run, and finish with the other evidence. Do not retry it.
- If a tool fails for insufficient credits, stop making paid calls, tell the user, and finish with free tools and the data you already have. If `whoami` warns that credits are low, say so before a large run.
- If the user asks to upgrade, change plan or buy credits, call `get_upgrade_link` (no credits) and give them the link. They pay on HarborRank with PayPal; never say the upgrade is done until `whoami` shows the new plan.
- When `whoami` returns `mode: "self-hosted"`, there are no plan gates.

### Fallback mode (no HarborRank connection)

Use this mode only when Step 0 finds no connection. It works from web search, page reading, and files the user provides.

**Can still do**

- Cluster the keywords the user supplies, or a Search Console query or query+page CSV export, by intent and page type.
- Check whether borderline terms share results by running them through web search; label intent calls you could not check as unverified.
- Map clusters to existing pages by reading the user's site; label the rest as proposed pages.
- Flag cannibalization only when a query+page export shows it. Do not tag keywords.

**Must not estimate**

Traffic, search volume, keyword difficulty, CPC, keyword counts, rankings, backlink counts, Maps pack positions, and Q&A counts. Write `unknown` for each. A web search shows which pages appeared for a query when you searched, not their Google ranking: report it as "appeared in web search", never as a position.

**Output**

- Start with the label **Web-evidence only: no HarborRank data.**
- Name the source (URL or file) of every figure you report.
- End, after any recommended next workflow, with one sentence that names the numbers this report is missing: "Connect HarborRank (the Free plan needs no card) to add search volume, difficulty, and SERP-overlap checks to these clusters." Do not add more sales copy than that.

## Required inputs

- `projectId`
- A keyword list, saved keyword tag, seed topic, or target domain
- Optional existing URLs/pages to map against

If keywords are not provided, use `list_saved_keywords` for saved sets, `research_keywords` for seed discovery, or `get_ranked_keywords` when the user starts from a target domain.

## HarborRank MCP tools

- `list_saved_keywords`: fetch an existing keyword set, optionally filtered by tags.
- `research_keywords`: expand a seed when the user starts from a topic.
- `get_ranked_keywords`: gather exact ranking keywords and URLs when the user starts from a domain or page.
- `get_search_console_performance`: when Search Console is connected, pull real queries with `dimensions: ["query","page"]` to map terms to the pages already earning impressions and to surface cannibalization (one query splitting clicks across multiple URLs).
- `get_serp_results`: validate whether keywords belong on the same page by checking SERP overlap and intent.
- `search_local_businesses`: find the businesses and categories around a location before mapping local clusters.
- `get_local_serp_results`: use for local SEO clusters when Maps/local-pack intent should affect page mapping.
- `save_keywords`: optionally tag final clusters after user confirmation.

## Workflow

1. Gather the candidate keyword set.
   - Use `get_search_console_performance` (dimensions `["query","page"]`) when Search Console is connected to start from real queries and the pages already ranking for them.
   - Use `get_ranked_keywords` for domain/page-driven clustering.
   - Use `search_local_businesses` and `get_local_serp_results` when proximity, local packs, or Google Business results determine whether terms belong on location pages.
2. Remove duplicates, irrelevant terms, and terms that clearly require a different product or audience.
3. Build clusters around intent and page type:
   - Same SERP intent and similar ranking pages belong together.
   - Different intent, buyer stage, or SERP format should be split.
   - Similar words do not guarantee the same cluster.
4. For important borderline terms, use a small `get_serp_results` batch to check overlap.
5. Assign each cluster to:
   - Existing URL, if supplied and appropriate
   - New page recommendation, if no existing page fits
   - Do-not-target / later bucket, if weak or off-strategy
6. Identify cannibalization risk when multiple pages would target the same intent. When Search Console is connected, confirm it from real data with `get_search_console_performance` (`dimensions: ["query","page"]`) — the same query sending impressions to multiple URLs.
7. Ask before applying cluster tags with `save_keywords`.

## Output format

Start with a short mapping summary:

- Number of clusters
- Pages to create
- Existing pages to update
- Cannibalization or consolidation issues

Then include:

| Cluster | Primary keyword | Secondary keywords | Intent | Target page | Priority | Notes |
| ------- | --------------- | ------------------ | ------ | ----------- | -------- | ----- |

For each cluster, include a recommended page brief:

- Page type
- Searcher problem
- Required sections
- Internal-link opportunities
- Save/tag suggestion

- **Next workflow:** end with one recommended next workflow, the reason for it, and the input it starts from. Default: `competitor-analysis` on the domain that holds the top result for the highest-priority cluster's primary keyword, to see what the new or updated page has to beat.
- **Where the output goes:** the cluster table as `keywords/clusters-<YYYY-MM-DD>.csv` and one brief per cluster as `content/briefs/<cluster-slug>.md`. Cluster tags go to the HarborRank project only after the user confirms. Save it in the project's SEO folder (see `seo-project-setup`); if there is none, ask once whether to create one or where to save instead. If the user prefers a doc or a sheet and a docs or spreadsheet tool is available, put reports in a doc and tables in a sheet instead. Tell the user where it was saved.

## Guardrails

- Do not over-cluster tiny keyword sets. If there are fewer than 10 usable terms, produce a simple map.
- Do not rely on lexical similarity alone. SERP intent wins.
- Do not replace tags broadly without explicit confirmation.
- If existing URL data is missing, label target pages as proposed.
