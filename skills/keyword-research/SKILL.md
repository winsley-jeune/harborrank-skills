# HarborRank Keyword Research

## Goal

Turn seed topics into a prioritized keyword opportunity set using HarborRank MCP data. The output should help the user decide what to target, what to save, and what to research next.

## Step 0: Check connection

Before any other step, confirm the HarborRank MCP tools are loaded. Look for `get_domain_overview` or `list_leads` among your tools, including deferred tools you can load (the name may carry a prefix such as `mcp__harborrank__`). If they are there, call `whoami`: it uses no credits, confirms the user is signed in, and returns `creditsRemaining` for budgeting the run. Do not call a research tool to test the connection.

If neither tool is available, or `whoami` fails because the user is not signed in, tell the user plainly: "HarborRank isn't connected, so I can't pull live HarborRank data yet." Then tell them how to connect it:

- Claude Code with the HarborRank plugin: run `/mcp`, choose `harborrank`, and sign in.
- Claude Code without the plugin: run `claude mcp add --transport http --scope user harborrank https://app.harborrank.com/mcp`, then `/mcp` to sign in.
- Other clients: add `https://app.harborrank.com/mcp` as a remote MCP server. Setup for each client is at https://harborrank.com/docs/mcp.

Do not stop there. Continue in fallback mode (below). If the user connects HarborRank mid-task, run Step 0 again and switch to the full workflow.

### Plan limits

On hosted HarborRank, research tools spend credits. The Free plan has 1,000 credits a month and one project; paid plans start at $29/month with 15,000 credits. Search Console, saved keywords, rank tracker reads, and site crawls use no credits. A keyword search costs about 50 credits and a domain overview about 80. Backlinks, lead research (`research_lead`), and Lighthouse checks need a paid plan.

- If `creditsRemaining` will not cover the planned calls, give the user the estimate and ask before spending. Use the free tools first.
- If a tool replies that a feature "is included in paid plans", tell the user once which feature needs a paid plan, skip that tool for the rest of the run, and finish with the other evidence. Do not retry it.
- If a tool fails for insufficient credits, stop making paid calls, tell the user, and finish with free tools and the data you already have.
- When `whoami` returns `mode: "self-hosted"`, there are no plan gates.

### Fallback mode (no HarborRank connection)

Use this mode only when Step 0 finds no connection. It works from web search, page reading, and files the user provides.

**Can still do**

- Gather keyword ideas from seed topics and from web search: related searches, autocomplete suggestions, and People Also Ask questions.
- Work striking-distance queries (average position 5-20) from Search Console CSV exports in the workspace. Those figures are the user's own data; report them with the file as the source.
- Read the top results for the leading candidates to judge intent and what a winning page needs.
- Prioritize on business fit and intent, and deliver the shortlist as a table or file the user can save later. Do not save keywords.

**Must not estimate**

Traffic, search volume, keyword difficulty, CPC, keyword counts, rankings, backlink counts, Maps pack positions, and Q&A counts. Write `unknown` for each. A web search shows which pages appeared for a query when you searched, not their Google ranking: report it as "appeared in web search", never as a position.

**Output**

- Start with the label **Web-evidence only: no HarborRank data.**
- Name the source (URL or file) of every figure you report.
- End, after any recommended next workflow, with one sentence that names the numbers this report is missing: "Connect HarborRank (the Free plan needs no card) to add search volume, keyword difficulty, and CPC to this shortlist." Do not add more sales copy than that.

## Required inputs

- `projectId`
- One or more seed topics, products, pages, competitors, or audience problems
- Optional market/location/language

If `projectId` is missing, use `list_projects` first. If the target market/location/language is unclear and would materially affect keyword metrics, ask the user; otherwise use the MCP tool defaults.

## HarborRank MCP tools

- `research_keywords`: primary discovery tool. Use 1-5 seeds per call and prefer 150 results unless the user asks for exhaustive research.
- `get_keyword_metrics`: hydrate up to 700 known keywords with volume, keyword difficulty (KD), search intent, CPC, and monthly trends in one call. Use it to score candidate or known terms — including the Search Console striking-distance queries from step 1.
- `get_ranked_keywords`: pull exact ranking keyword rows when a target domain or page is part of the research brief.
- `get_search_console_performance`: when Search Console is connected, start from the project's real first-party demand — queries already earning impressions and near-ranking ("striking distance") terms. Request a high `rowLimit` and filter average position 5-20 client-side, since the API sorts by clicks and can't filter by position. Then hydrate those striking-distance queries with `get_keyword_metrics` to attach difficulty and intent.
- `get_serp_results`: inspect SERPs for the top candidate terms, especially when intent is ambiguous.
- `search_local_businesses`, `get_local_serp_results`, and `get_google_business_questions`: use for local SEO topics when a business/location radius matters.
- `list_saved_keywords`: avoid duplicating already-saved work or use existing tags as context.
- `save_keywords`: save selected keywords only after explicit user confirmation.

## Workflow

1. Normalize seeds into a small set of distinct research angles. If Search Console is connected for the project, first pull `get_search_console_performance` (high `rowLimit`, default lookback), filter to striking-distance positions (~5–20) client-side, and hydrate those queries with `get_keyword_metrics` to attach KD and intent. That ranked, hydrated list is your fastest opportunity set — work it before broad discovery.
2. If the request is local SEO, identify the business, location/coordinates or service area, and local categories. Use `search_local_businesses` and `get_local_serp_results` for the most important location/keyword set instead of relying only on national keyword/SERP data.
3. Call `research_keywords` for exploratory seeds. Use bulk calls when possible.
4. Use `get_keyword_metrics` to hydrate a fixed keyword list — or the striking-distance queries from step 1 — with volume, KD, and intent before prioritizing.
5. Use `get_ranked_keywords` when the user provides a domain/page and wants opportunities based on current rankings, near-misses, or competitor-owned terms.
6. Remove irrelevant, duplicate, branded-only, and off-intent terms.
7. Prioritize by practical opportunity, not volume alone:
   - Strong match to the user's product/page/topic
   - Clear search intent
   - Reasonable difficulty
   - Useful volume/CPC signal
   - SERP where the user can plausibly compete
   - For local SEO, local-pack/Maps visibility and proximity fit
8. Use `get_serp_results` for high-potential or ambiguous keywords when SERP intent would change the recommendation; keep the default check small.
9. Present a shortlist and a longer opportunity table.
10. Ask before saving keywords. When saving, suggest concise tags such as `topic:<topic>`, `intent:<intent>`, or `page:<slug>`.

## Output format

Start with the highest-signal recommendation:

- Best opportunity theme
- Top keywords to target now
- Keywords to save
- Risks or SERP caveats

Then include a compact table:

| Keyword | Intent | Volume |  KD | CPC | Priority | Notes |
| ------- | ------ | -----: | --: | --: | -------- | ----- |

End with whether to save the chosen keywords.

- **Next workflow:** end with one recommended next workflow, the reason for it, and the input it starts from. Default: `keyword-clustering` on the shortlist, to decide which page targets each keyword. If one domain holds the top results for most of the shortlist, recommend `competitor-analysis` on that domain instead.
- **Where the output goes:** the opportunity table as `keywords/<topic>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.csv`, with the summary at the top of `keywords/<topic>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`. Keywords the user approves are also saved to the HarborRank project with `save_keywords`. Save it in the project's SEO folder (see `seo-project-setup`); if there is none, ask once whether to create one or where to save instead. If the user prefers a doc or a sheet and a docs or spreadsheet tool is available, put reports in a doc and tables in a sheet instead. Tell the user where it was saved.

## Guardrails

- Do not invent metrics. If HarborRank does not return a value, write `unknown`.
- Do not call `save_keywords` without explicit confirmation.
- Prefer business-fit and intent-fit over chasing the largest volume term.
